# pgrst-dev-setup

pgrst-dev-setup is a collection of docker-compose ymls, shell scripts and some config files for a quick workflow to experiment with PostgREST.  
It provides the database, the application and some tooling to help interact with the system. After a session it also saves the docker logs for i.e. debugging purposes.

## Ports

- 5001: postgrest
- 5002: postgrest (will show up in mitmproxy web)
- 5003: pgadmin4
- 5004: swagger
- 5005: mitmproxy web

## Requirements

You need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. If you have `tmuxp` installed, you can also use the session file to a even quicker start.


## Installation

Underlying software installation happens when docker starts the necessary containers. That means you only need to clone this repository to get started.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Qu4tro/pgrst-dev-setup/
cd pgrst-dev-setup
```
You can change the files inside `data` to change the loaded configurations and the database startup script.

Note: All commands attach to the terminal. If you want to avoid using multiple terminal windows you can use the included `tmuxp` script.

## Usage
```
./start
```
Starts postgres, postgrest and mitmdump (for comprehensive logging). The database is served on the port 5000 and the server on 5001.
Dumps a `logs.txt` with logs from all these three containers after exiting.

---
```
./start <tool>
```
